Every line is a single statement and must begin with a line number.

There are four statements:
set x rhs           Sets variable x to the value of rhs.
print val           Prints value.
jump linenum        Jumps to specified line.
jumpif val linenum  Jumps to specified line if val is logically true.

The rhs of a set statement can be:
val
val operator val

A val can be:
Identifier: all lowercase letters.
Literal string: anything inside double quotes (except a double quote).
Integer: a string of digits.

Operators: + - * / < > =

There are two data types, integer and string. The + operator concatenates if one of its operands is a string. String comparison with < > = is possible. The integer 0 and string "" are logically false; all other values are logically true. There are no unary operators; to set x to -1, use:

10 set x 0 - 1
